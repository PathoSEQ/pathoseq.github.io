the webpage can be found at: https://pathoseq.github.io

If you want to change something there are two options:

## Small text editing on the fly
Just open visual code inside the browser (press "." on your keyboard) and navigate to index.html (or imprint/ privacy).

Each section section starts with a comment with the same name as on the webpage.  
E.g. if you want to edit the "Why choose us?" section just scroll to 

```html
<!-- 
    
Why choose us

-->
```

and start editing the text. The moment you commit its updated to the webpage after a few minutes.

## Major editing and style changes

If you want to do major changes and confirm first how it looks:

1) clone the git to your local machine
2) open visual studio code
3) Install the extension "Live Server" (only once)
4) Open index.html and right click inside the document, choose "Open with live server"
5) this opens the html in your browser. It updates everytime you change something and press save (ctrl+s)
